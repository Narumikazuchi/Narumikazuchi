<h1 align="center">Greetings traveler!</h1>
  
I taught myself programming relatively early on in my life. I was fascinated by the things I could create by writing just some words and numbers. Over the years I have developed simple mods for games, tools, automated procedures, and worked with SQL databases.  
I am most proficient in programming APIs and libraries or packages. However I am not really talented in creating any form of UI/UX. But I could still collect some experience in those fields due to my job career, being a programmer at a university for 2 years as well as working in a software company creating mostly web applications for 2 years.  
I am constantly interested in the newest technologies, like the newest iterations of the .NET Core Framework or machine learning/AI.  
My experience in various programming languages and tools can be roughly seen here:

<h1 align="center">More about myself</h1>
<p>
I really enjoy the process of problem solving. Most of my personal programming solutions stem from either problems I encountered or from features I was missing in other applications. An example of that are my <a href="https://github.com/Narumikazuchi/Extensibility">Extensibility</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Narumikazuchi/Generators.ByteSerialization">ByteSerialization</a> solutions. Most of my personal projects had similar roots. There are also projects where I'm just interested in the way the problem is solved.

Not too long ago I started to learn C++ to expand my horizon. My first project has been a plugin for the so called 'BAKKES MOD', which is a mod for the game 'Rocket League'. I plan to further my research and improve my understanding of the language and it's perks.
