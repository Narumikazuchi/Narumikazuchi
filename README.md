<h1 align="center">More about myself</h1>
<p>
I really enjoy the process of problem solving. Most of my personal programming solutions stem from either problems I encountered or from features I was missing in other applications. I was for example dissatisfied with the functionality of the windows file explorer, so I created my own. Most of my personal projects had similar roots. There are also projects where I'm just interested in the way the problem is solved. I've worked for a university until recently and am therefore also quite familiar with SQL and the possibilities to connect to a SQL server via C#.

Not too long ago I started to learn C++ to expand my horizon. My first project has been a plugin for the so called 'BAKKES MOD', which is a mod for the game 'Rocket League'. I plan to further my research and improve my understanding of the language and it's perks.
